                <h2> Our Mission </h2> 
                <p> Our main mission is to succeed in our dreams to save endangered wild species. Throughout our history, we have never missed any opportunities to save our wildlife. Hence, I believed that we have made lots of missions. Animals should have the right to live freely, without being killed or exploited by humans. </p> 
                <br>
                <h2> Our Vision </h2> 
                <p> Our vision is to have a clear future that the next human generation could have a chance to see almost all of the animals that we have seen. We sincerely do not want them to just see an extinct animal in a picture book since we all have experienced that feeling. We sympathize with them. Therefore, we will never let it happen. </p>

                <h1> Our <span> History </span></h1>
                <p>"Safe Wildlife" was established in 2000 by a group of passionate         individuals: Rubia, Violet, and Heather who sought to provide funding for      plants and animals who are threatened by human development. They began by employing individuals with similar ambitions to save wildlife. Initially, they educated local people, slowly received donations and funds from local organizations, and connected with other local wildlife-conservation organizations to collaborate and look out for animals in the local forests.

                    <p>After 5 years as 'Safe Wildlife', they are receiving funds on a global basis and saving animals from forests all around the world. Therefore,they decided to create a website in order to interact more with their global supporters who are willing to provide them. In 2002, the non-profit yet helpful website of 'Safe wildlife' was formed. Their story is TO BE CONTINUED.......  </p>

                    <p> Over a career spanning 10 years, Violet has put considerable effort to protect environmental preservation and transform the forest to be filled with wildlife animals. We were able to reach over 30 countries due to her progress. She grew up in the southern part of the country, surrounded by wildlife. Going to The British University of Conservation, she has become intrigued by the subject. She would volunteer in communities keeping the wildlife safe. She soon found her passion and her willingness to become a conservation officer. Throughout the years, she has participated in various kinds of teams and visited certain kinds of forests where endangered species' habitat is, promising to conserve wildlife species around the world. </p>

                <p> Since the 'Safe Wildlife' organization was founded, Rubia had been working for saving endangered species along with other officers. She takes charge in identifying the legal issues as well as corporate governance and business policy for the organization. With her help, we easily managed to collaborate with the local communities and global organizations.

"Safe Wildlife will not excuse illegitimate actions toward wild species and we are going to take action along with animal welfare policies and rights," She said. </p>
