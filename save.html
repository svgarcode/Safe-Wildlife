            <p> Worldwide, 90% of all living creatures are on the brink of extinction. Nevertheless, we can help them together. Wondering how to help endangered species? Learn more below. </p>

    <h1> Ways to help endangered animals </h1>
    <div class="ways-save">
        <h2> Learn! </h2>
        <p> Everything starts from yourself. Educate yourself on local endangered animals, as well as species native to your area. You will develop a deeper understanding of wildlife issues and gain the skills needed to make responsible decisions. As a result, becoming an educated person in the area of endangered animals will definitely help in saving our wildlife. </p>
        <h2> Spread the word! </h2>
        <p> Raise awareness by posting posters or articles related to endangered species. If you are really fond of this topic, you can even make your own page which would collect all the information about certain topic. In addition, you could educate to young people, your relatives and friends about how wildlife is facing danger. </p>
        <h2> Be ethical! </h2>
        <p> Never purchase products made from endangered species like ivory, coral and tortoise shell. These are all products made from illegal poaching of wildlife animals. The illegal wildlife trade thrives because there is a market to support it. If you are one of the people who do so, you are supporting an industry that is a major contribution to the decline of various endangered species. </p> 
        <h2> Donate to conservation organization! </h2> 
        <p> Donate to organizations created to help our wildlife animals (like us) You can protect threatened species and their habitats today with a donation to Safe Wildlife. Your support of Safe Wildlife's global conservation work will make all the difference. </p>

        <div class="save-why">
            <h1> Why we should save wildlife </h1> 
            <p> Now that you have known that we should put considerable time, effort and money into saving endangered animals, you would ask the reason WHY. Extinction is the termination of a kind of organism or of a group of kinds, usually a species. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of the species. Plus, the biggest cause is the loss of habitat. Once those species gone, they're gone forever, and there's no going back. Accordingly, losing even a single species can have disastrous impacts on the rest of the ecosystem, because the effects will be felt throughout the food chain. </p>

    <div class="child">
            <h2> For the pleasure of our grandchildren </h2>
            <p> If only we could save those animals that are facing with extinction, our next generation could happily be able to see them at least once in their real world. We simply get the enjoyment by going out to the zoo and keep in touch with the nature along with animals. It can not only help us relieve our stress but also make us stay out of the world filled with confusion, anxiety and disappointments for a few hours. On the contrary, it is painful as well as traumatic for some people when they can only learn about those animals on the picture book or through the Internet. </p>

        <div class="environment">
            <h2> For the sake of our environment </h2> 
            <p> Generally speaking, everything in natured is connected to each other. Healthy ecosystems depend on plant and animal species as their foundations. Each species that is lost triggers the loss of other species within its ecosystem. Humans depend on healthy ecosystems to purify our environment. </p>
