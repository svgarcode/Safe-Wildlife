        <p> Tigers are the largest living cat species on our planet and we value them for their beauty. However, tigers are classified as endangered and if we do not take proper care for this species, it can lead to us not being able to see them in our lifetime. </p> 
    </div> 
    <div class="tiger-text">
        <h2> Tiger population is lessening day-by-day </h2> 
        <p> Tiger population has declined in numbers due to habitat loss. Urbanization and fragmentation in tiger corridors are the major reasons for their decrease. This habitat loss has a huge impact on the decrease in the numbers of precious big cats in more ways. The situation began to look very gloomy as a loss of natural habitat is in a way affecting the overall food chain and cramping not only tigers but all other species for space.  Both global warming and climate change have resulted in the rise of sea levels which is wiping out the large groups of tiger habitats. If we include the fact that tigers are also hunted for their pelt and bones for decorative items and also losing their habitats and prey, tiger populations are threatened even throughout their own natural habitats. </p>
        
        <h2> Threats Tigers Face </h2> 
        <p> These huge species become endangered by deforestation and poaching. Since hundred years ago, people believed that tigers' body parts can heal diseases and illnesses even though there is no proof and evidence. On the other hand, tigers pelts and bones are used for decorations and wines. Furthermore, at least 8000 tigers are left in tiger farms which is double than those which are left in the wild. Tiger farms are the places where tigers are bred to make medicines and trades with money. In those places, tigers are killed between one and two years old and always live in cages without freedom. Despite the fact that tiger trading was banned starting in 1987 in China, they are still growing and there are estimated to be more than 200 tiger farms in China and southern Asia. <br><br>
        Deforestation is also a huge threat for tigers as well. Tigers' habitats are located in rainforests, grasslands, and mountains across the Asia continent. However due to the human population growth, urban developments and mining nature resources, forests were cut down at a huge rate. As a result, the habitats of most animal species including tigers had disappeared since their living places were in the forests. In our 'Endangered species 2022' article, it has shown that the main threat for tigers and other animal species was caused by deforestation. </p> 

        <h2> We <b>MUST</b> Save Our Tigers </h2> 
        <p> Tigers live in a large range of forests. Therefore, saving tigers means saving the forests. An adult tiger lives within 267 to 296 kilometer square of the forest area. In those enormous lands, there will be a large number of wild animals and living organisms including insects, birds and plants. These living creatures also rely on those forests which are homelands for tigers. To summarize, saving one species can save other living things as well as the green forests. </p> 

        <h2> The Process of Conserving </h2> 
        <p> A total of 20 Safe Wildlife members are working on the process of conserving tigers in the forests of Southern. The team consists of conservationists, researchers, veterinarians and volunteers. A petrol team monitors the tiger population, checking known tiger areas to keep track of what is happening to them. Researchers study their population trends and the reasons for population increase and decrease. Others manage the food supply for tigers and protect their livestock while volunteers educate locals about wildlife-conflict and illegal poaching and trading. </p> 

        <h2> Conclusion </h2>
        <p> In conclusion, the process of conserving tigers has been doing well due to the donations of our supporters who enable us to receive the funds needed to operate.
